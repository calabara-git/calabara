Our community here at Calabara is on a mission to build the best web3 tools specifically tailored for the wants and needs of DAOs. Calabara was started based on the fundamental belief that people build things better, together. We’re all unbelievably passionate about the potential of DAOs and how they will impact the way people will work. Calabara can help make this concept a reality while revolutionizing the way DAOs operate. Our software is the vessel for influencing and sharing our core beliefs and vibes with the rest of the web3 world.

## V1

V1 is our first release. It's an ultra simple platform that allows communities to create organization dashboards. These dashboards are meant to achieve 2 goals in V1:

### **Help members stay up to date**

It can be difficult for even the most active community members to keep up with everything happening in the DAO. Between proposals, events, and updates, it isn't easy. V1 supports integrations with community calendars and snapshot spaces to help keep everyone up to date. 

### **Simplify onboarding**

By using token-gates on community documents, organizations can regulate what the newbies see. Rather than scrolling through discord links and messages, potential members can navigate a one-stop-shop for community documentation dedicated to new and potential members.

V1 is a continuous work in progress. It will be constantly iterated and improved with new features and enhancements based on feedback from other communities, as well as our own.
