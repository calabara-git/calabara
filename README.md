## V1

V1 is our first release. It's an ultra simple platform that allows communities to create organization dashboards. These dashboards are meant to achieve 2 goals in V1:

### **Help members stay up to date**

It can be difficult for even the most active community members to keep up with everything happening in the DAO. Between proposals, events, and updates, it isn't easy. V1 supports integrations with community calendars and snapshot spaces to help keep everyone up to date. 

### **Simplify onboarding**

By using token-gates on community documents, organizations can regulate what the newbies see. Rather than scrolling through discord links and messages, potential members can navigate a one-stop-shop for community documentation dedicated to new and potential members.

V1 is a continuous work in progress. It will be constantly iterated and improved with new features and enhancements based on feedback from other communities, as well as our own.
